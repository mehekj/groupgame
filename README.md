## Run Instructions
You must have Node.js and npm installed to run this. Clone this repo and navigate to the folder in a command line. The first time you run it you will need to run `npm install`. After that, or any subsequent time you would like to start it, run `npm start`.
The site will be running on http://localhost:3000/. If running locally you can test the game by connecting to the site as different players in separate tabs.

## Usage Instructions
The first player who wants to join a game should enter a nickname and create a room of the desired size selected in the dropdown menu.
Once the room is created you should see a room code in the chat dialogue on the right side of the window.
Any subsequent players who would like to join the game should select a nickname and then enter this code in the form under "Join a Room."
When the room has reached the set capacity, the game will begin. To place a token on your turn simply click the target column. Players can chat using the
menu on the right and when the game ends, a button will appear to play again.
